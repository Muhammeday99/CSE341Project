## Main Functions of the Program

#### Entity Cards

An entity card is an accounting term. En ERP and Accounting Programs, just like 5M Macro's Project Tracking System, an entity card is used to represent the company or organization using the system to represent another person or legal entity, whom there is a customer-creditor relationship exist, to keep track of their records.

We are holding some data such as type, kind, name, code, email, phone etcetera... User of the system enters these variables and the data is sent to the database, where it can be accessed after the fact.

#### Expense Definition

Every company has its own expenses, say phone bills, electricity bills, car expenses, renting fees, wages of the personnel and so on. If a company is serious about its future, it must hold these expenses somewhere. What we have, is just for that.
